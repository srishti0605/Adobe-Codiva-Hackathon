A company has decided to promote interactions between its female employees in various departments. The objective of this is to ensure that the female employees get a common forum to address their
grievances and discuss their concerns. In order to do so they want to figure out the pre-existing connections between the various female employees working in their organization.

They have created a number of nodes which are to be connected to form a cluster to find the above information. The nodes are described by a 2D grid of 0s and 1s with n rows and m columns, a
cell containing a zero denotes a male employee, while a cell containing a one is a cell that denotes a female employee(node).
The cluster creation happens as follows: for every grid row i, every node in this row is connected with every node in row inext - the first row to have any nodes in it after row i. If there is no such inext , the
connections don't happen.

Given a grid, describing the nodes(female employee). What is the number of connections in the cluster formed by the nodes in the grid?

In the example below, 3 nodes in the first row get connected with 2 nodes in the second row, forming 6 connections. Then 2 nodes in the second row get connected with 1 node in the last row, forming 2
connections. There are 8 connections in total:

1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0

Function Description

Create a function as per the below description. It has the following
parameter(s):

Parameters:Name 		Type 		Description
           gridOfNodes 		INTEGER 	Grid
				2D ARRAY	description
				
					
Return: The function must return an INTEGER denoting the number of connections.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 500
1 ≤ m ≤ 500
1 ≤ gridOfNodes[i][j] ≤ 1

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of rows in gridOfNodes
The next line contains an integer, m, denoting the number of columns in gridOfNodes
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i < n) contains m space separated integers each describing the row gridOfNodes[i]

Output Format:
Output an INTEGER denoting the number of connections.

Sample Output
0
Sample Output Explanation

There is only one row with nodes, so no connections happen

Sample Output
28
Sample Output Explanation
5 nodes in the first row get connected with 4 nodes in the second
row, 20 connections. Then 4 nodes in the second row get connected
with 2 nodes in the third row, 8 connections. 20+8 = 28 connections
in total.
